# **Computer Graphics using OpenGL**

This repository contains all the files related to Computer Graphics that I have performed in UPES Dehradun. I am attaching a file which contains the basics of the Computer Graphics using OpenGL which would help you to understand the concepts in better way. The experiments that I have performed are listed below :

## **Experiment 1 : Introduction to OpenGL**
 
1. Green Window Program.

## **Experiment 2 : Drawing line using DDA, Bresenhamâ€™s algorithm**

1. Drawing a line using Equation of line.
2. Drawing a line using Bresenham algorithm for m<1.
3. Drawing a line using Bresenham algorithm for m>1.
4. Drawing a line using DDA algorithm.

## **Experiment 3 : Drawing Circle and Ellipse using Mid-point algorithm**

1. Draw a circle using the polar equation.
2. Draw a circle using midpoint circle algorithm.
3. Draw a circle using bresenham circle algorithm.
4. Draw an ellipse using midpoint ellipse algorithm.

## **Experiment 4 : Filling the objects using flood fill, boundary fill and scan line fill algorithm**

1. Boundary fill algorithm using 4 connected approach.
2. Boundary fill algorithm using 8 connected approach.
3. Flood fill algorithm using 4 connected approach.
